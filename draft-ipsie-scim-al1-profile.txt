1.  Introduction

   This document defines the IPSIE Account Lifecycle 1 (AL1) Profile for
   SCIM 2.0.  It provides a clear reference for SCIM deployments that
   require a well-defined security baseline meeting best practices for
   interoperable enterprise identity management.

   The profile addresses critical aspects of secure identity management,
   with particular emphasis on:

   *  Client authentication

   *  Retrieve, add, and modify Users.

   *  Retrieve, add, and modify Groups.

   *  Synchronization of data from the Identity Service to the
      Application

   By adhering to this profile, organizations can implement SCIM-based
   integrations that meet stringent security requirements while ensuring
   interoperability across different implementations.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC2119 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Terminology

   SCIM

      The System for Cross-domain Identity Management as defined in
      [RFC7643] and [RFC7644]

   SCIM Client

      An application that uses the SCIM protocol to manage identity data
      maintained by the service provider.  The client initiates SCIM
      HTTP requests to a target service provider.

   SCIM Service Provider

      An HTTP web application that provides identity information via the
      SCIM protocol.

   Role

      TODO: Add definition

   Identity Service

      Acts as the SCIM client, initiating all provisioning operations.

   Application

      Acts as the SCIM service provider, hosting SCIM endpoints and
      processing all provisioning requests.

   Note: When SCIM is applied to the context of IPISIE, the Identity
   Service acts as the SCIM client and the Application acts as the SCIM
   service provider.  The document will use the Role terms below for
   consistency between across IPSIE Profiles.

3.  Profile

3.1.  Authentication and Authorization

   The Identity Service and Application MUST use OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] for
   authentication and authorization of SCIM protocol.

   // TODO: Should this link back to SL1?

   // TODO: Expand Section

   The following requirements ensure consistent and secure handling of
   access tokens and authorization server configuration:

   // TODO: Be more explicit with token names.

   *  OAuth 2.0 interactions MUST comply with JWT Client Authentication
      as defined in [RFC7523]

   *  The token SHALL exchange a signed JWT for an access token and
      present that token in the {Authorization: Bearer} header on all
      subsequent SCIM requests.

   *  The token MUST contain a "token_endpoint" value which is the URL
      of the Identity Service's OAuth 2.0 token endpoint.

   *  The Acess Token MUST include the "scim" scope and not grant
      broader permissions.

   *  All Authorization Server parameters SHOULD be discovered from
      OAuth Authorization Server metadata as defined in [RFC8414].

   *  The Identity Service SHOULD expose a jwks_uri to allow the
      Application to perform signature verification

3.2.  SCIM Interoperability Requirements

3.2.1.  General Requirements

   *  The Identity Service SHALL implement the required functionality of
      a SCIM client as defined in [RFC7643] and [RFC7644].

   *  The Application SHALL implement the required functionality of a
      SCIM service provider as defined in [RFC7643] and [RFC7644].

   *  All SCIM operations SHALL be authenticated and authorized via
      OAuth 2.0 as specified in Section 3.1.

   *  Local modifications to Users or Groups in the Application are
      prohibited.

3.2.2.  User Provisioning Operations

   The Application MUST provide support all User provisioning operations
   defined in this section.

3.2.2.1.  Create User (POST /Users)

   User creation is performed by the SCIM operation POST /Users.

   In addition to the user attributes required by [RFC7643], the
   following attributes are required to be part of the User schema:

   // TODO: Should we keep this vauge or refer be explicit with
   attributes we are requiring? email vs emails?

   *  An attribute which contains a unique identifier used by the
      enterprise to distinguish the owner of the account, such as
      "externalId."

   *  An attribute which contains the primary email address of the user,
      such as "email"

3.2.2.2.  Update User (PATCH /Users/{id})

   User updates are performed by the SCIM operation PATCH /Users/{id}

3.2.2.3.  Deactivate or Reactivate User (PATCH /Users/{id})

   Changes to the user activation status, such deactivation and
   reactivation, are performed by the SCIM operation PATCH /Users/{id}

   The Identity Service SHOULD propagate user deactivation events to the
   Application within 5 minutes of the user being deactivated.

   The Application SHOULD respond to user deactivation events by
   revoking the ability for the user to continue accessing the
   Application, including the revocation of currently active sessions.
   The revocation mechanism outside the scope of this profile.
   Revocation SHOULD occur within 5 minutes of receiving the
   deactivation request.

   When a user account is deactivated, all access mechanisms and
   authorizations associated with that account MUST also be deactivated.
   This includes, but is not limited to:

   *  Web sessions

   *  API tokens

   *  Refresh tokens

   *  Personal access tokens

   *  SSH keys associated with the user

   *  Device-based authentication credentials

   The Application MUST allow reactivation of a deactivated user.

3.2.2.4.  Delete User (DELETE /Users/{id})

   User deletions are performed by the SCIM operation DELETE /Users/{id}

   After a user is deleted, the Application MUST allow the creation of a
   new user with the same username.

   // TODO: this could be tricky RE: maintianing the user's data

3.2.2.5.  Get All Users (GET /Users)

   Get all users in the system is performed by the SCIM operation GET
   /Users

   This endpoint ensures that all users are managed by the Identity
   Service.

   To ensure that large amounts of data can be read from the
   Application, the application must support with index-based or cursor-
   based pagination for the GET /Users request.  To ensure system
   stability and prevent abuse, the Application SHALL enforce rate
   limits on this endpoint and must respond with appropriate headers,
   such as "429 Too Many Requests" and "Retry-After," when limits are
   exceeded.

3.2.2.6.  Get User By ID (GET /Users/{id})

   User searches by id are performed by the SCIM operation GET
   /Users/{id}

3.2.2.7.  List Users By Alternate Identifier (GET /Users?)

   User searches by alternate identifier are performed via the SCIM
   operation: GET /Users?filter={filterExpression}

   Application Providers MUST support the following filter expressions:

   *  username eq {username}

   *  externalId eq {externalId}

   *  emails[value eq {email}]

3.2.3.  Group (Role) Provisioning Operations

   The Application MUST provide support all Group provisioning
   operations defined in this section.

   *Note*: Within the IPSIE standard, Application permissions are
   referred to as "Roles."  Within SCIM, Application permissions are
   referred to as "Groups."  The term "Role" in IPSIE is functionally
   equivalent to the term "Group" in SCIM.

3.2.3.1.  Create Group (POST /Groups)

   Group creation is performed by the SCIM operation POST /Group.

   // TODO: Add more details

3.2.3.2.  Get All Groups (GET /Groups)

   A search for all groups in the system is performed by the SCIM
   operation GET /Groups

   This endpoint ensures that all groups are managed by the Identity
   Service.

   To ensure that large amounts of data can be read from the
   Application, the application MUST support with index-based or cursor-
   based pagination for the GET /Groups request.  To ensure system
   stability and prevent abuse, the Application SHALL enforce rate
   limits on this endpoint and MUST respond with appropriate headers,
   such as "429 Too Many Requests" and "Retry-After," when limits are
   exceeded.

3.2.3.3.  Get Group By ID (GET /Group/{id})

   Group searches by id are performed by the SCIM operation GET
   /Group/{id}?excludedAttributes=members

3.2.3.4.  List Groups By Alternate Identifier (GET /Groups?)

   User lookups by alternate identifier are performed by the SCIM
   operation GET
   /Groups?filter={filterExpression}&excludedAttributes=members

   Application Providers MUST support the following filter expressions:

   // TODO: Add what filters are required to be supported

3.2.3.5.  Add or Remove Group Members (PATCH /Group/{id})

   Members are added or removed from Groups via the SCIM operation PATCH
   /Groups/{id}

   For each Operation in the PATCH:

   The op attribute MUST contain either "add" or "remove".

   *  When the op is "add":

      -  The path attribute MUST be "members".

      -  The value attribute MUST be an array of Group member elements,
         as defined in Section 4.2 of the SCIM Core Schema [RFC7643].
         Each member MUST contain a value subattribute with the id of
         the resource being added to the group.

   *  When the op is "remove":

      -  The path attribute MUST be either:

         o  "members" (to remove all members)

         o  "members[value eq {id}]" (to remove a single member)

      -  The value attribute MUST be unspecified.

3.3.  Metadata Endpoints

3.3.1.  ResourceTypes

   Application MUST host a /ResourceTypes endpoint, as defined in
   Section 4 of [RFC7644].

   The supported ResourceTypes MUST include Users and Groups.

3.3.2.  ServiceProviderConfig

   Application Providers MUST host a /ServiceProviderConfig endpoint to
   describe the operations they support, as defined in Section 4 of
   [RFC7644]

   The operations MUST include, at minimum, the set of SCIM capabilities
   required for compatibility with this IPSIE profile.

3.3.3.  Schemas

   Application Providers MUST host a /Schemas endpoint to describe the
   supported schemas, as defined in Section 4 of [RFC7644].  There must
   be a schema for both Users and Groups.  The schemas must include all
   required attributes from RFC 7643 and from Section 3.2.3 (Create
   User).

3.4.  Security Considerations

   For SCIM security considerations, see [RFC7643] and [RFC7644]

   Additionally, the following requierements are included to address
   security considerations.

   *  *Transport Security*: All endpoints SHALL enforce TLS 1.2 or later
      with strong cipher suites and certificate validation.

   *  *Error Handling*: Error responses SHALL use the SCIM error format
      and SHALL NOT leak internal details.

   *  *Replay Resistance*: Access tokens SHALL expire and nonces SHALL
      be validated to prevent replay.

   *  *Auditing*: All provisioning actions and responses SHALL be logged
      for audit and troubleshooting.

   *  *Rate Limiting*: All endpoints SHALL enforce rate limiting and
      must respond with "429 Too Many Requests" when limits are
      exceeded.

4.  Compliance Statement

   Implementation of all mandatory requirements in this profile will
   result in a SCIM 2.0 deployment that satisfies IPSIE Identity
   Lifecycle Level 1 (IL1).  Specifically:

   *  *Identity Service (SCIM client)*

      -  SHALL initiate all CRUD operations for Users and Groups.

      -  SHALL adhere to the security considerations above.

   *  *Application (SCIM service provider)*

      -  SHALL host all SCIM endpoints with full support for User and
         Group provisioning.

      -  SHALL prevent local modifications outside of SCIM.

      -  SHALL enforce OAuth 2.0 JWT Profile for Authentication
         [RFC7523].

      -  SHALL adhere to the security considerations above.

   By conforming to this profile, implementations will achieve a
   consistent, secure, and interoperable baseline for enterprise
   identity lifecycle management.
